# PGP signature checking
# NOTE: None of this will work without running `pacman-key --init` first.
# The compiled in default is equivalent to the following line. This requires
# you to locally sign and trust packager keys using `pacman-key` for them to be
# considered valid.
#SigLevel = Optional TrustedOnly
# If you wish to check signatures but avoid local sign and trust issues, use
# the following line. This will treat any key imported into pacman's keyring as
# trusted.
#SigLevel = Optional TrustAll
# For now, off by default unless you read the above.
SigLevel = Never

#
# REPOSITORIES
#   - can be defined here or included from another file
#   - pacman will search repositories in the order defined here
#   - local/custom mirrors can be added here or in separate files
#   - repositories listed first will take precedence when packages
#     have identical names, regardless of version number
#   - URLs will have $repo replaced by the name of the current repo
#   - URLs will have $arch replaced by the name of the architecture
#
# Repository entries are of the format:
#       [repo-name]
#       Server = ServerName
#       Include = IncludePath
#
# The header [repo-name] is crucial - it must be present and
# uncommented to enable the repo.
#

# The testing repositories are disabled by default. To enable, uncomment the
# repo name header and Include lines. You can add preferred servers immediately
# after the header, and they will be used before the default mirrors.
